## Tracing Antisemitic Language Through Diachronic Embedding Projections: France 1789-1914
https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-4715

#### Abstract
We investigate some aspects of the history of antisemitism in France, one of the cradles of modern antisemitism, using diachronic word embeddings.  We constructed a large corpus of French books and  periodicals issues that contain a keyword related to Jews and performed a diachronic word embedding over the 1789-1914 period. We studied the changes over time in the semantic spaces of 4 target words and performed embedding projections over 6 streams of antisemitic discourse. This allowed us to track the evolution of antisemitic bias in the religious, economic, socio-politic, racial, ethic and conspiratorial domains.  Projections  show a trend of growing antisemitism, especially in the years starting in the mid-80s and culminating in the Dreyfus affair.  Our analysis also allows us to highlight the peculiar adverse bias towards Judaism in the broader context of other religions. 

## Embeddings
The embeddings will be available soon.
